# Graph-Filter (linear)
* Extremely optimized and thus faster implementation of linear low-pass graph filter part in GF-CF (Shen et al. CIKM'21)

* You can find the original implementation of full GF-CF method in: https://github.com/yshenaw/GF_CF


# Dependancy
* numpy
* Pytorch
* Scipy 

# Running
You can simply test & run cells in 'Graph Filtering (Light).ipynb'
